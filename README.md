# Heart Disease Prediction (ML)
The objective of this project is to determine/predict a person's heart condition, if he/she has a heart disease or not.  
To achieve this, I have implemented a Logistic Regression ML model. Based on the dataset acquired from Kaggle, sample features were  
taken into account and was ultimately used to predict the target value (0 or 1). 
0 --> Patient does not have a heart disease  
1 --> Patient has a heart disease<br><br>
