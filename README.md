# Heart Disease Prediction (ML)
The objective of this project is to determine/predict a person's heart condition, if he/she has a heart disease or not.  
To achieve this, I have implemented a Logistic Regression ML model. Based on the dataset acquired from Kaggle, sample features were  
taken into account and was ultimately used to predict the target value (0 or 1).<br><br>
0 --> Patient does not have a heart disease  
1 --> Patient has a heart disease<br><br>
## Tools and technology
1. Python
2. Scikit-learn
3. Logistic Regression
4. Pandas
5. Numpy<br><br>
## Process
- Dowload the heart_disease_data file and the **Heart_disease_prediction_ML.ipynb** file from this repository
- Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
- Upload the download python file
- Navigate to the notebook that was uploaded on Colab
- Click on file icon on the left and upload the dataset
- Run the notebook<br><br>
